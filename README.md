# Data Structures & Algorithms
This repository contains popular algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

## Algorithms
An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
